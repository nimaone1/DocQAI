# LocalGPT RAG Node.js Library Specification

## Library Overview
This Node.js library provides developers with a complete toolkit to build private, local document question-answering systems using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The library handles all backend functionality for document processing, vector storage, and AI-powered question answering, allowing developers to create applications where users can upload documents and ask questions about their content without sending data to external services.

## Core Library Features

### Document Processing Module
- **File Upload Handler**: Accepts PDF, TXT, DOCX, and other text-based documents through file streams or file paths
- **Text Extraction Engine**: Automatically extracts and cleans text content from various document formats
- **Document Chunking**: Intelligently splits documents into contextually meaningful chunks with configurable size and overlap
- **Processing Status Tracking**: Provides real-time callbacks and events for monitoring document ingestion progress

### Vector Database Integration
- **Embedding Generation**: Converts document chunks into high-quality vector embeddings using local models
- **Vector Storage**: Manages local vector database for storing and indexing document embeddings
- **Similarity Search**: Performs fast semantic search across document collections to find relevant content
- **Index Management**: Handles creation, updating, and deletion of document indexes

### Question-Answering Engine
- **Query Processing**: Accepts natural language questions and converts them to searchable vectors
- **Context Retrieval**: Finds and ranks the most relevant document chunks for each question
- **Response Generation**: Uses local language models to generate contextual answers based on retrieved documents
- **Source Attribution**: Provides detailed citations showing which documents and sections were used for each answer

### Model Management
- **Local Model Loading**: Downloads and initializes language models and embedding models locally
- **Model Switching**: Allows runtime switching between different available models
- **Resource Management**: Handles memory allocation and cleanup for optimal performance
- **Configuration Options**: Provides settings for model parameters, response length, and retrieval settings

## Developer Integration Points

### Library Initialization
```javascript
// Example usage developers will implement
const localGPT = new LocalGPTRAG({
  modelName: 'llama2-7b',
  embeddingModel: 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2',
  chunkSize: 1000,
  chunkOverlap: 200
});
```

### Document Management API
- **Upload Documents**: `addDocument(filePath, metadata)` - Process and index new documents
- **Remove Documents**: `removeDocument(documentId)` - Delete documents from index
- **List Documents**: `getDocuments()` - Retrieve all indexed documents with metadata
- **Document Status**: `getProcessingStatus(documentId)` - Check processing progress

### Query Interface
- **Ask Questions**: `query(question, options)` - Submit questions and receive AI-generated answers
- **Get Sources**: Responses include source document references and page numbers
- **Conversation Context**: Support for follow-up questions that maintain conversation history
- **Streaming Responses**: Optional streaming for real-time response generation

### Event System
- **Processing Events**: `onDocumentProcessed`, `onProcessingProgress`, `onProcessingError`
- **Query Events**: `onQueryStart`, `onQueryComplete`, `onSourcesFound`
- **Model Events**: `onModelLoaded`, `onModelError`, `onModelSwitch`

## Configuration Options
